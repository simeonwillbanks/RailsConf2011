We are going to talk about choice!
  You have a lot of choices
  We are going to help you solve bikeshedding
    http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding
  
Its all Josh Susser's fault
  Rails is opinionated, but opinion is relative
  There are a lot of choices
  
Handle Choice
  Avoid the "this suz/this rulz"
    Not about getting into fist fights
    This isn't the argumentation we are worried about
  Factor in organization realities
    Legacy issues
    Resources
  Look for key qualitative differences, not just minor flavor diffs
    Trying to pinpoint where a tool makes qualitative diff
    
Avoiding the "this suz/this rulz"
  Look for the key differences!
    Example is HAML
      exists to protect you from HTML
      have to get use to new markup language
  What you really have to think about it is: (template for thought process)
    Is HTML a problem for your team?
    Do you have time to get used to HAML?
  Don't just be a fan or advocate, but think about tool line by line so to speak
  
Organization Realities
  Who gets to see what?
  Who gets to change what?
    Database schema
  Are some decisions already made?
    Database schema
    Deployment tool chain

Qualitative Differences
  Looking at different tools and finding something where one tool doesn't overlap
  A lot of times, tools do overlap, but you must look for qualitative differences
  A good example of qualitative difference is Liquid
    Liquid changes the relationship with the technology
    Safe for users because they can't inject arbitrary code
    
Rails 3 Modularity vs Choice
  Modularity is different than choices in Rails
  Modularity is more an architectural concern
  
What if there is no qualitative choices?
  Fairly simple when there is a deterministic path
  If you can't make the decision, then don't
    Make sure its a decision you need to make
  Can you use both options? 
  Can you gently migrate?
    With old tests, when you need to write a new test, write it in new testing framework
  Should you use anything at all?
    Don't use a gem when you can "reinvent the wheel" in 5 lines!
  Why not defer until is shakes out?
    Put Cucumber into play but don't use until clients are ready to write scenarios
    No reason to put aspects into project in beginning and brow beat at beginning

How to avoid fallout?
  Keep it logical, keep it classy
    Use whiteboard to list both arguments
    Erase all emotion, you'll see very little logic
  Look at facts not opinions
  If there aren't any qualitative 
  
Absorbing the fallout
  Make decision, make people stick too it, don't back paddle, be the decision dbag with thick skin
  Learn to be a diplomat or tyrant
    Try diplomatic measures, only be tyrant when necessary 
    
Get this poster
  The 3 D's of ZMOG Decisions
  Decide (the direction)
  Deliver (the mandate)
  Discuss (the impact)

So how does one decide?
  Pick the direction your are doing
  Be the dbag
  Can be diplomatic for voting, or make the managerial decision
  These two are the only two options you have for making the choice
