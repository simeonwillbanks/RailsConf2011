### WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CHOICE!
* You have a lot of choices
* We are going to help you solve [bikeshedding](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding)
    
  
### ITS ALL JOSH SUSSER'S FAULT
* Rails is opinionated, but opinion is relative
* There are a lot of choices
  
### HANDLE CHOICE
* Avoid the "this suz/this rulz"
  *   Not about getting into fist fights
  *   This isn't the argumentation we are worried about
* Factor in organization realities
  *   Legacy issues
  *   Resources
* Look for key qualitative differences, not just minor flavor diffs
  *   Trying to pinpoint where a tool makes qualitative diff
    
### AVOIDING THE "THIS SUZ/THIS RULZ"
* Look for the key differences!
  *   Example is HAML
    *     exists to protect you from HTML
    *     have to get use to new markup language
* What you really have to think about it is: (template for thought process)
  *   Is HTML a problem for your team?
  *   Do you have time to get used to HAML?
* Don't just be a fan or advocate, but think about tool line by line so to speak
  
### ORGANIZATION REALITIES
* Who gets to see what?
* Who gets to change what?
  *   Database schema
* Are some decisions already made?
  *   Database schema
  *   Deployment tool chain

### QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES
* Looking at different tools and finding something where one tool doesn't overlap
* A lot of times, tools do overlap, but you must look for qualitative differences
* A good example of qualitative difference is Liquid
  *   Liquid changes the relationship with the technology
  *   Safe for users because they can't inject arbitrary code
    
### RAILS 3 MODULARITY VS CHOICE
* Modularity is different than choices in Rails
* Modularity is more an architectural concern
  
### WHAT IF THERE IS NO QUALITATIVE CHOICES?
* Fairly simple when there is a deterministic path
* If you can't make the decision, then don't
  *   Make sure its a decision you need to make
* Can you use both options? 
* Can you gently migrate?
  *   With old tests, when you need to write a new test, write it in new testing framework
* Should you use anything at all?
  *   Don't use a gem when you can "reinvent the wheel" in 5 lines!
* Why not defer until is shakes out?
  *   Put Cucumber into play but don't use until clients are ready to write scenarios
  *   No reason to put aspects into project in beginning and brow beat at beginning

### HOW TO AVOID FALLOUT?
* Keep it logical, keep it classy
  *   Use whiteboard to list both arguments
  *   Erase all emotion, you'll see very little logic
* Look at facts not opinions
* If there aren't any qualitative 
  
### ABSORBING THE FALLOUT
* Make decision, make people stick too it, don't back paddle, be the decision dbag with thick skin
* Learn to be a diplomat or tyrant
  *   Try diplomatic measures, only be tyrant when necessary 
    
### GET THIS POSTER
* The 3 D's of ZOMG Decisions
  * Decide (the direction)
  * Deliver (the mandate)
  * Discuss (the impact)

### SO HOW DOES ONE DECIDE?
* Pick the direction your are doing
* Be the dbag
* Can be diplomatic for voting, or make the managerial decision
* These two are the only two options you have for making the choice
  
### HARD NUTS TO CRACK
* See slide???
